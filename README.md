# Stroop_7
Stroop with three words and XXX

The task comprises 5 experimental conditions (1 CONgruent and 4 INCongruent). The conditions are as follows (in examples, assume that the ink color is blue):
*     CON.CON.CON (e.g., BLUE BLUE BLUE) – no WWI and Stroop facilitation (baseline);
*     INC1.INC1.NEU (e.g., RED RED XXX) – two identical words grouped, thus NO-WWI-STRONG-GROUPING;
*     INC1.NEU.INC1 (e.g., RED XXX RED) – two identical words ungrouped (NO-WWI-WEAK-GROUPING);
*     INC1.INC2.NEU (e.g., XXX RED GREEN) – two different words grouped (WWI-GROUPING);
*     INC1.NEU.INC2 (e.g., RED XXX GREEN) – two different words ungrouped (WWI-NO-GROUPING);

The experiment has a fully randomized repeated-measures design, with multiple trials per condition. It includes 5 within-subject conditions: CON.CON.CON, INC1.INC1.NEU, INC1.NEU.INC1, INC1.INC2.NEU, INC1.NEU.INC2. CON.CON.CON consists of 320 trials and the other of 80 trials each, adding up to 640 trials in total. The probability of presenting each INC condition is 25%.
